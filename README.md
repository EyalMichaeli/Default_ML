# Default_ML

This notebook was created as part of a Machine Learning academic course.
The idea is to use the dataset UCI_Credit_Card to improve basic skills of data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization and machine learning. 
Any feedback is welcome.

 The goal is to predict the default of clients in a bank.

Dataset Information
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

Some ideas for exploration:

How does the probability of default payment vary by categories of different demographic variables?
Which variables are the strongest predictors of default payment?
