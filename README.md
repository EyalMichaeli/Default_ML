# Default_ML

This notebook was created as part of a Machine Learning academic course.
The idea is to use the dataset UCI_Credit_Card to use skills we learned in class: data cleaning, data analysis, feature engineering, data visualization and machine learning. 
Any feedback is welcome.

 The goal is to predict the default of clients in a bank.
